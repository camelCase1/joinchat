# ðŸŽ¨ UI Improvements Complete

All the requested UI improvements have been successfully implemented:

## âœ… 1. Fixed Chat Room UI Design

**Problem**: Chat room interface was using dark theme colors instead of the original white/grey/red design.

**Solution**: Updated the chat room interface to match the original design:
- âœ… **RecentChatsSidebar**: Changed from dark theme to white background with grey borders
- âœ… **Color scheme**: Now uses white/grey/red colors consistently 
- âœ… **Active room highlighting**: Uses red color for currently selected room
- âœ… **Hover states**: Light grey hover effects instead of dark
- âœ… **Typography**: Grey text colors with proper contrast

**Files modified**:
- `src/components/chat/RecentChatsSidebar.tsx` - Complete theme update

## âœ… 2. Room Search Autocomplete

**Problem**: Room search was basic with no autocomplete functionality.

**Solution**: Implemented intelligent autocomplete dropdown:
- âœ… **Real-time search**: Shows results as you type
- âœ… **Keyboard navigation**: Arrow keys to navigate, Enter to select, Escape to close
- âœ… **Visual feedback**: Highlighted selection with red accent
- âœ… **Room details**: Shows participant counts and status badges
- âœ… **Performance**: Limits to 8 results for smooth scrolling
- âœ… **Smart focus**: Auto-shows on focus if there's a search term

**Features**:
- Arrow Up/Down: Navigate through results
- Enter: Join selected room
- Escape: Close dropdown
- Click: Select any room
- Blur: Auto-close after delay

**Files modified**:
- `src/components/chat/RoomList.tsx` - Added autocomplete functionality

## âœ… 3. Room Deletion Feature

**Problem**: No way to delete empty rooms.

**Solution**: Added room deletion for solo users:
- âœ… **Smart detection**: Delete button only shows when user is alone in room
- âœ… **Database validation**: Server confirms user is the only active member
- âœ… **Confirmation dialog**: Prevents accidental deletions
- âœ… **Real-time updates**: Notifies other components of room deletion
- âœ… **Proper cleanup**: Cascades delete to messages and memberships
- âœ… **Error handling**: Shows appropriate error messages

**Security**:
- Server-side validation ensures only solo users can delete rooms
- Database constraints prevent orphaned data
- User confirmation required for irreversible action

**Files modified**:
- `src/server/api/routers/post.ts` - Added `deleteRoom` procedure
- `src/components/chat/ChatRoom.tsx` - Added delete button and logic
