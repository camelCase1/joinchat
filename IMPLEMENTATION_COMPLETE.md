# 🎉 Database Integration Complete

The Join.Chat application has been successfully updated to use the SQLite database with Prisma ORM. All core functionality is now working with persistent data storage.

## ✅ What's Working

### 1. **Authentication System**
- ✅ User signup saves to database with proper schema
- ✅ User login validates against database
- ✅ Password hashing and verification (basic implementation)
- ✅ User sessions persist in localStorage
- ✅ User profiles with display names, badges, trust scores

### 2. **Chat Room Management**
- ✅ Room creation and storage in database
- ✅ Room listing with participant counts from database
- ✅ Room joining/leaving tracked in database
- ✅ Featured rooms and room search functionality
- ✅ Participant management with active status tracking

### 3. **Message System**
- ✅ Messages saved to database with proper relationships
- ✅ Message history retrieval from database
- ✅ Real-time messaging via Socket.io + database persistence
- ✅ Message types (TEXT, IMAGE, VIDEO, SYSTEM) support

### 4. **Recent Chats Sidebar**
- ✅ Recent chats loaded from database (not localStorage)
- ✅ Chat history with last message and timestamps
- ✅ Participant counts from active room members
- ✅ Automatic updates when joining/messaging in rooms

## 🏗️ Database Schema

The app uses a comprehensive schema with:
- **Users**: Profile data, badges, trust scores, online status
- **ChatRooms**: Room metadata, participant limits, featured status
- **RoomMembers**: Join/leave tracking, active status, last seen
- **Messages**: Full message history with user relationships
- **MutedUsers**: User muting functionality

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev:full  # Starts both Next.js and Socket.io servers
   ```

2. **Access the app:**
   - Main app: http://localhost:3000 (or 3002 if 3000 is busy)
   - Socket.io server: localhost:3001

3. **Test the functionality:**
   - Sign up with email/password - saves to database
   - Create or join chat rooms - stored in database
   - Send messages - persisted to database
   - Check recent chats sidebar - loads from database
